# Shell Scripts  
These are a few useful shell scripts that I use on my Unix systems. I have made a list of them and their short descriptions below:

1. `tailscale-ip` - This copies to the X clipboard the IP address of the TailScale device hostname I pass as a variable to standard input
    Compatibility: Linux (since it relies on X11 and `tailscaled` is Linux only ATM
2. `git-config-local` - This configures the current Git repository to commit as a particular user. Useful if you commit to different repos across organisations with different emails
    Compatibility: Unix
